Question : Youâ€™ve been asked to evaluate the effectiveness of a new marketing campaign that was launched last month.
 How would you approach this analysis as a data analyst?


Clairfying Questions : 
        - What data do I have access too? 
        - 
Data : 
Sales Data:
Date (transaction date)
Total_Sale (value of each sale)
Customer_Segment (new, returning, VIP)
Sales_Channel (online, in-store)
Product_ID, Product_Category

Marketing Campaign Data:
Campaign_ID
Start_Date and End_Date
Marketing_Channel (social media, email, TV, etc.)
Total_Spend (how much was spent on the campaign)
Impressions (number of people who saw the campaign)
Clicks (number of people who interacted with the campaign)
Conversion_Rate (percentage of clicks that resulted in a sale)

Customer Data:
Customer_ID
Customer_Segment (new, returning)
Region

Answer : 
    The first thing that I would do is seperate the marketing campaign data into visualizations using the start_date and the end_date.
    From this I would be able to see increases or dips with different campaigns along with the date that it happened. 
    I would segment the new marketing campaign with Conversion_Rate, Total_Sale, and Customer_Segment. This would show 
    the number of clicks resulting in a sale, the types of customers conversioning, and the total sales from that Conversion_Rate. 
    If there is a dip or increase in sales, I would look further into the Marketing_Channel and compare that to other marketing campaigns, if that has a lack of information to our problem 
    I would then look at the rate of impressions and clicks compared to the conversion_rate.
    If there was a drop, I would hypthesis that maybe the marketing campaign was not on the right Marketing_Channel. 
    I would then test the new marketing campaign with the older ones, helping the company see the metrics and the right steps to take.
