Question : Suppose a company wants to understand why their monthly sales have dropped. 
        How would you approach analyzing this problem as a data analyst?

Columns:
Transaction_ID
Date
Customer_ID
Product_ID
Product_Category
Units_Sold
Unit_Price
Total_Sale (Units_Sold Ã— Unit_Price)
Region
Sales_Channel (Online, In-Store, etc.)
Discount_Applied (Yes/No)
Customer_Segment (New, Returning, VIP)


Answer: 
    First I would ask a clairfying question, what are the columns / rows I am dealing with? ^
    If the monthly sales were to drop, I would first create a visualization showing the dip using the date columns and the total sales column to understand trends by time.
    If time doesn't tell us anything, I would get the distrubtion of total_sales and the sale_distrubtion, to find if online sales are dropping or in-store sales were dropping
    I would then take a look at the distrubtion of the types of customers. And finally the distrubtion of the product category. 
    Maybe the company has dropped in new customers, we can use marketing or discounts to gain those new customers back.
