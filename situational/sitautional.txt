Technical Discussion Question : 
"Imagine you're given a messy dataset with missing values, 
inconsistent formatting, and duplicate entries. 
Walk me through how you would approach cleaning and 
preparing this data for analysis."


Answer (No AI): 

If I'm given a messy dataset the first thing I would do is check for null values using pandas,
After doing that I would proint out the dataset and see where the formatting errors or duplication takes place. 
If it takes place in one column, for example if the Name column has inconsistenties with capitalization I would use str() functions to make it look cleaner and easier to read
With duplication, I would utilize df.duplicated to first check if a row indicates True showing duplicates or False with no duplicates. 
Getting those rows with duplication, I would use drop_duplicates() method to remove the duplicate rows from the dataframe.

Improvments : 
    - Add stucture, step 1, step 2, step 3, 
    - Start with undersatnding the data, using .info(), .describe()
    - explain why using some methods
