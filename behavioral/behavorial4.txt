Tell me about a time when you had to manage multiple tasks with tight deadlines. How did you prioritize and handle everything?

S: I had an essay due in Political Science, a project in my Web Docker course, and soccer game all in one day. This was in the middle of our Fall season, so midterms very cruical to my grade. 


T: In order to juggle everything at once, i first cleared my schedule from work. Letting myself have enough time to prioritize the things that matter. 
    

A I organized my work into pieces, focusing on the most critcal and time consuming, which was my essay. I would break it into chucks, 25%, and my least critcal in smaller chuncks, so like 15%
    In terms of my game that week, i made sure to get 8 hours of sleep and mealprep homecooked meals, so I could spend my time wisely 




R: From this, I was able to get A's on both my midterms, and was able to give my full effort and win our soccer game.
