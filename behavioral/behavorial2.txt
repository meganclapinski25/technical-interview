Question 1 : 
Tell me about a time when you had to work with a team on a project with a tight 
deadline. What was your role, and how did you handle it? 

Answer 1 (no AI): 

So for one of my classes the team and I had to work with a company to create a new Front-End
page that was user friendly and captivating for new users. I was assigned to delegate the roles and consult the client
on their expectations and how we could meet them. What I did to ensure our team met the deadline
was to meet twice a week to deliever stand-ups for each team member. That way the whole team knew everyones next steps, what they worked on
and if they occured any blockers. From doing that and opening up the meeting to discussions afterward. We were able to meet the deadline with time to spare
in case anything had to be changed or fixed.
